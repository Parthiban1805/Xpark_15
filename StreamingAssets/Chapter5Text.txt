Well done for configuring the Firewall Correctly!
We now need to test your work. Alex will come help us with this.
Hello guys! Let's test the Firewall!
When you're ready, please press the test button to make an access attempt from an HR Workstation.
BREAK
START
Perfect! The Firewall allowed the HR Workstation to access both the HR Application Server, and the HR Database.
Huh? What's this?
It appears as though someone is attempting to access restricted information held in the HR Database.
BREAK
START
Nice! they couldn’t access the HR Servers. The firewall did its job!
What does the Log say?
BREAK
START
Looks like Marketing tried to sneak into the HR Database, but we blocked them. The log recorded the attempt with their IP address.
Good! Now, let’s check if the alert was triggered.
BREAK
START
Great work! This way, we can monitor any suspicious activity and respond immediately. Logs and alerts are critical to maintaining network security.
