Welcome, Cyber Defender! Today, we'll secure our HR application and database. 
Let me first show you the Notebook. Please click the Notebook icon to open the Notebook.

This is where you'll record the network devices' information. There is a lot to remember, so do check back here often.

Securing HR data is critical â€” personal employee information must be protected from unauthorized access and breaches. 
Only authorized HR personnel should access this sensitive data. Let's configure our firewall to ensure this.
To configure the Data Centre Firewall, we first need to find the network information of the Workstations used by the HR Employees.
This will allow us to tell the Firewall "who" is allowed through.
Please click on the HR Workstation Icon to access the INFO tab.
BREAK
START
192.168.1.0 represents a network, devices within this network will have similar IP addresses. The Subnet Mask "/24" indicates that the first 24 bits are used for the network portion of the IP address.
Please press the Highlighted button to record this information in your Notepad.
Then press the "Close" button to close this menu.
BREAK
START
Perfect! The Source IP Addresses are now written in your Notebook.
Next we need to gather the network information of the destination that the sources are attempting to access.
Please click the Indicated HR Application Server Icon to see its INFO tab.
BREAK
START
There is only one HR Application Server, so only a single IP address. 
But, there is extra information here. The Protocol and Port information. 
The Protocol can be thought of as the "language" that is spoken between the HR Workstations and the Server.
The Port can be thought of as a "room number" of a Hotel. Where the IP is the Address of the Hotel. We use port 443 for HTTPS.
We need all three, please record them in the Notebook.
BREAK
START
We now have everything we need to configure the Data Centre Firewall.
Please click the Data Centre Firewall Icon to access the RULES tab.
BREAK
START
There are four rules we need to create: an ALLOW Rule, DENY Rule, ALERT Rule, and LOG Rule.
We'll start with the ALLOW Rule.
Please click the top "+" icon to create a new rule.
BREAK
START
First lets select the Rule Type. Set the Rule Type to ALLOW.
BREAK
START
Next we should define the Source IP Addresses. You can check your Notebook if you can't remember them.
BREAK
START
Now lets add the Destination IP Address. There is only 1 destination in this case, so no Subnet of multiple IP Addresses.
BREAK
START
Finally, lets add the Protocol and Port, again you can check your Notebook if you don't remember which to choose.
BREAK
START
That's Perfect!
We have now told the Firewall to specifically allow the HR Workstations to access the HR Application Server.
We should now create another rule to DENY access from any other Workstations.
Please click the next "+" icon to create another new rule.
BREAK
START
Select the DENY rule type.
BREAK
START
To refer to "any" IP Address, we simply put "0.0.0.0/0", this refers to all devices on the network.
Please set the source to the all IPs Subnet "0.0.0.0/0".
BREAK
START
We are still controlling access to the HR Application Server, so the Destination IP Address, Protocol, and Port will be the same as before.
BREAK
START
Great! We now have told the Firewall to DENY all access attempts from all IP Addresses that are not specified in the ALLOW rule.
Next we want to create an ALERT rule, this will send an Alert whenever an unauthorized access attempt is made.
Please create another new rule.
BREAK
START
This time, we set the rule type to ALERT.
BREAK
START
We want to report all unauthorized access attempts, so we use any IP address as "0.0.0.0/0" as the source.
BREAK
START
And finally, the Destination, Protocol, and Port are again the same as the previous rules.
BREAK
START
The Final Rule we need to create is the Log Rule.
This rule will write the details of the access attempts in a log file.
Please create one more new rule.
BREAK
START
Now select the LOG rule type.
BREAK
START
We again want this rule to operate on all access attempts, so please select the 0.0.0.0/0 option for the source.
BREAK
START
And for the final time, this is still the HR Application Server, so the Destination, Protocol, and Port are all the same.
BREAK
START
Amazing! Well Done! We have successfully told the Data Centre Firewall to correctly protect the HR Application Server.
Next we will need to do the same for the HR Database. 
I won't guide you on this one. But I have written the instructions on the 2nd page of your Notebook.
Please press the CHECK button when you're done, and I'll check your work. Good Luck!
BREAK
START
That's perfect! Let us now test our configuration to make sure it is working.
